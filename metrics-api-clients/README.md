## Metrics app api clients
These clients are auto generated using openapi specs.
By having the openapi file written for the server APIs, we were able to leverage
this and provide easy to use languages specific clients that anyone can easily use
without the hassle of implementing the API layer from scratch.

### Generated clients
- `metrics-go-client` (For backend services written in golang)
- `metrics-kotlin-client` (For andorid apps)
- `metrics-swift5-client` (For ios apps written in swift5)
- `metrics-typescript-client` (For fromend apps written in typescript)
